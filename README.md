# Socket Programming Project in C

### - Implementing a simple Reliable UDP (RUDP)
  - Designing packets (header and data)
  - Splitting large data into chunks
  - Adding reliability with a handshake to start connection, ACK packets, and checksum
  - Simple API
### - Transferring large files over TCP or RUDP
### - Simulating packet loss in order to:
  - Compare TCP Reno and TCP Cubic
  - Compare TCP and RUDP

## Example runs:

### Part A - Tranferring a large file over TCP:

Choosing between TCP Reno and TCP Cubic
